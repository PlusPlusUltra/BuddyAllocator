# BuddyAllocator

An implementation of the malloc function, like the one found in the C standard library. It uses a buddy allocator to manage memory.

It was useful for me to learn a lot about Linux system programming and internals, memory management and the details of the malloc as it is implemented in the C standard library. I think it can also be useful for other operating systems students to study how memory management algorithms work.

The original project was an implementation of the buddy allocator algorithm only, and I expanded on it later on.
